# Day 2 - Greeting App

# Ask for user's name and age
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Display a message using concatenation
print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old!")

# Optional: Try using f-strings (cleaner way to format text)
print(f"Hi {name}! You're {age} years young.")
